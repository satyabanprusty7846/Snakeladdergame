# 🐍🎲 Snake and Ladder Game – C Language

## ✅ 1. What is Unique in My Project
Many students choose similar Snake & Ladder or simple C-programming games.  
*My project includes unique improvements*, such as:

- ✔ Realistic dice roll using rand() with proper time(0) seeding  
- ✔ *Exact 100 rule* implemented for realistic gameplay  
- ✔ Custom snake & ladder mapping  
- ✔ Interactive terminal messages (ladder climbed, snake bitten, invalid move)  
- ✔ Modular functions like rollDice() and checkSnakeOrLadder()  
- ✔ Clean, structured, beginner-friendly design  
- ✔ Better user experience with ENTER-to-roll system

## 💻 3. Programming Language Used & Why  

### *Language: C*
C was chosen because:
- It is the foundation language taught in the course  
- Great for logic-building and understanding flow control  
- Ideal for console games  
- Provides full control over loops, functions, and randomization

## 🔧 4. Libraries, Functions & Techniques Used

### *Libraries Used*
| Library | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| stdio.h | Input/Output operations |
| stdlib.h | Random number generation (rand()) |
| time.h | Seeding random generator (time(0)) |

### *Main Functions*
- rollDice() → Generates values between 1–6  
- checkSnakeOrLadder() → Checks and updates position for snakes/ladders  
- main() → Game loop, position updates, input handling  

### *Techniques Implemented*
- Random number generation  
- Modular programming  
- User-interactive terminal gameplay  
- Conditional game logic  
- Loop-based game flow

## 🎮 5. Features of the Project
- 🎲 Dice rolling system  
- 🪜 Ladders that move the player upward  
- 🐍 Snakes that pull the player downward  
- ❗ Exact number required to reach 100  
- ⌨ Press ENTER to roll  
- 🔁 Continuous game loop  
- 🎉 Winning message on completion

## ⚙ 6. How the System Works
1. Player starts at *position 1*  
2. User presses *ENTER* to roll the dice  
3. Dice output (1–6) increases position  
4. Snakes/ladders are checked  
5. If move exceeds 100 → move cancelled  
6. Loop continues until user reaches *exact 100*  
7. Program displays a winning message

## 🏁 7. Conclusion
This project shows my understanding of loops, logic, functions, and random number handling in C.  
My improvements make the project more interactive and different from standard versions.
